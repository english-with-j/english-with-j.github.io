<p>I write CVs and letters in English in html and pdf. 
I am an experienced writer and had written mostly biographies and 
encyclopaedic articles. I provide my clients with complete solution -
a well-styled document. Whereas CV-generating sites are usefull,
they do not ensure that the language used in your CV is correct.
I will handle the entire process of creating CV for you -
from liguistic diffculties to technical complexities of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">pdf-generating software</a>. 
</p>
<p>I'm based in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponferrada" target="blank">Ponferrada.</a>
Do not hesitate to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> if you are interested in 
having either your CV or a cover letter written for you.
