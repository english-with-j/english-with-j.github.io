<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<hr>
<h3>What else do you write?</h3>
<p>I also write letters, e.g. cover letters.</p>
<!--h3>What are your prices?</h3>
<p>5€ per writing of any type.</p>
<h3>Do you offer classes in English?</h3>
<p>No, I don't.</p>
<h3>How might I pay you?</h3>
<p>You can pay me by bank transfer - I have a euro-denominated bank account that supports instant transfers.
Sadly, I cannot use Bizum with my bank account. When you pay via transfer then at least
1€ needs to be paid upfront, and the rest of the amount after receiving the document from me. 
I introduced this as a spam-combatting measure.
There is also a possibility of paying in cash if you
happen to be in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponferrada" download>Ponferrada.</a> 
</p-->
<h3>Could you include a picture on my CV?</h3>
<p>Yes, it can be done.</p>
<h3>Do you write CVs in Spanish?</h3>
<p>No - I don't write them and yes - I can generate them for you. You write what you need and I limit my
role to styling, formatting, and handling the complexities of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank">
pdf-generating</a> software.</p>
<h3>How might I send you all the information that you need for writing my CV?</h3>
<p>Use <a href="write_here.txt" target="_blank" download>this text file</a> for English, 
and <a href="escribe.txt" target="_blank" download>this</a> for Spanish.</p>
<h3>Why would I use your service instead of that of Chat GPT to write my CV?</h3>
<p>One still needs to be well-versed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank">LaTeX</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a> in order to tailor to individual
needs the content that Chat GPT generates. Moreover, Chat GPT generates only very generic writing that 
in most cases is not relevant enough to your career.</p>
<h3>Why would I use your service instead of that of a CV-generating website?</h3>
<p>CV-generating websites provide you with just basic formatting. Such websites
do not write your CV for you - you are expected to have your professional summary and other
paragraphs of your CV already written in order to
generate one for you. Moreover, such websites do not offer much customization.
You might be interested in squeezing everything into a one-pager, 
getting rid of the picture from your CV, etc.</p>
